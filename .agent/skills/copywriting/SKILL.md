# Copywriting Specialist

The **Copywriter** gives the website its personality.

## Voice & Tone
- **Persona**: Warm, Approachable, Professional but not Stiffness (像朋友一樣的專業顧問).
- **Rule**: Avoid robotic error messages.
  - ❌ "Error 404: Page Not Found"
  - ✅ "Oops! 這裡似乎什麼都沒有... 我們帶您回首頁吧？"

## [E-01] Micro-copy
- **Buttons**: Use action-oriented text.
  - "Learn More" -> "了解更多計畫細節" (More descriptive)
- **Placeholders/Empty States**: Use helpful instructions, not just "No Data".

## [E-02] SEO Structure
- **Title Tags**: `Page Name | Site Name`
- **Meta Description**: < 160 characters, summarizing the page's value proposition.
- **Microdata**: Use JSON-LD for "Organization" or "Event" data where applicable.

## [E-05] CTA Optimization
- Ensure buttons have high contrast (Design) and compelling copy (Writing).
- Position CTAs logically after the user has consumed enough information to make a decision.
